# RNN-stock-prediction

Another attempt to use Deep-Leaning in the financial markets, the project is documented
here -> https://solbiatialessandro.github.io/RNN-stocks-prediction/ 

+Basic

If you wanna run the <b>regression model</b> (implemented with LSTM) just run regression.py

If you wanna run the <b>classification model</b> (implemented with LSTM) just run classification.py

If you wanna take a look at the code you can run the <b>framework</b> with a Jupyter Notebook

+Advanced

If you wanna predict stock prices [see docs] I uploaded a model (.hdf5) working at <b>63% accuracy with GOOGL</b>, you just need to upload it in KERAS and load it [ model.load_weights() ]
